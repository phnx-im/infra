## Notes for Translators

- **Air** should never be translated - it's the product name
- **Username** vs **Display Name**: Username is for finding people, Display Name is for identification in chats
- **Remove** vs **Delete**: Use "remove" for people, "delete" for content
- **Connect** implies the initial action of adding someone via username
- Consider cultural context for messaging terminology in your language
